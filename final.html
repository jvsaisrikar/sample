	<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the 
	largest of the terrestrial planets. Unlike the other plan
	ets in the solar system that are named after classic deities the Earthâ€™s name comes from the Anglo-Saxon 
	word erda which means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
